## Progress Report
Reshaping the data: 
1. Reshaping the data was really easy. I did get a bit confused at first when I mixed up the variables in the `spread` function but I learned through trial and error. 
2. At first glance at the data format I'm not sure how you would plot this. It seems a bit messy. I tried out a few plots, none of which I think are good or especially informative. Please see the hw for more details about my impressions
